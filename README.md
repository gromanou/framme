======

I see responcive page design as a present trend
Here is my attempt to understand it by creatign my own frammework.
Very simple but effective. 



# ===== To use Framme ====== 
1) Link framework file in a header file.
Also include following code at the head of a HTML document 
NOTE: links to .css files should reflect your file hierarchy . 
```
<meta name="viewport" content="initial-scale=1" />		
<link href="framme.css" rel="stylesheet" />
```
